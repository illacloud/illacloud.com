## <h2 hidden>What is MySQL?</h2>

MySQL in Illa is a database integration that allows you to connect and interact with a MySQL database. MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system that is known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use.

With the MySQL integration in Illa, you can query, insert, update, and delete data from a MySQL database using SQL commands. With the Appwrite integration in Illa, you can query, insert, update, and delete data from a Appwrite database using SQL commands. This makes it easy to build data-driven applications and dashboards that display real-time data from a MySQL database.

### Create MySQL

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

-   Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

![external_resource](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/external_resource.png)

Select **`MySQL`** from the database list.

![action_list]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready MySQL will display as shown.

-   Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`MySQL`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to MySQL database.

We have created a MySQL resource, we can add the action by selecting MySQL from action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

Now we have added the MySQL server as an action to our building page.
