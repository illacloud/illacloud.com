## <h2 hidden>What is Video?</h2>

The video component in ILLA Cloud is a powerful tool that allows users to incorporate multimedia content into their applications or projects. With this feature, users can seamlessly integrate videos into their user interfaces and create engaging and interactive experiences for their end-users.

The video component supports various video formats, including popular formats such as MP4, AVI, and MOV. Users can upload videos directly from their devices or provide URLs to external video sources. This flexibility enables users to leverage existing video content or create new videos specifically for their applications.

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following eight methods:

-   **play**

start playing the video. When invoked, it initiates the playback of the video from the current position.

-   **pause**

pause the video playback. When called, it temporarily stops the video at its current position.

-   **showControls**

toggle the visibility of the video player controls. By invoking this method, the controls can be displayed or hidden, allowing users to interact with the video playback.

-   **setVideoUrl**

dynamically change the source or URL of the video.

| Properties | Description      |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Video URL  | video source url |

-   **setVolume**

adjusting the audio volume of the video. It takes a numeric value as the parameter volume

| Properties | Description                                                                                                |

| Speed      | numeric value. 1 represents the normal playback speed. Values less than 1 slow down the video, while values greater than 1 speed it up. |

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to control the video playing with a button.

#### Step 1 Add Components

Add a **`Video`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas.

We set the video source of video component to the youtube link of any video you want to play. Here we will use the default video as example and labeled the button as “Play” as shown below

![video_layout](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/video_layout.jpg)

#### Step 2 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the **`video`** component playing if the video is not playing.

1.  Click the `**button**` component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`video1`** component that you want to change as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`play`** action
4.  In the **`Only run when`** field, put `{{!video1.playing}}`.

![video_config](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/video_config.jpg)

Similarly, to stop the video playing, we create a new Event handler and follow the first two steps the same as above.

1.  Choose the **`pause`** action
2.  In the **`Only run when`** field, put `{{video1.playing}}`.

![video_config_1](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/video_config_1.jpg)

#### Step 3 Test

Now that when you click the “Play” button, the video should play if not playing and pause if playing.
