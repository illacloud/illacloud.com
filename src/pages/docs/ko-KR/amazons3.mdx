## <h2 hidden>What is Amazon S3?</h2>

Amazon S3 is a highly scalable and secure cloud storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). When combined with ILLA Cloud, developers can seamlessly integrate Amazon S3 into their applications, leveraging its robust storage capabilities to store and retrieve data efficiently. ILLA Cloud simplifies the integration process, allowing developers to seamlessly connect to Amazon S3 and utilize its powerful features, such as data encryption, versioning, access controls, and seamless scalability. With the integration of Amazon S3 on ILLA Cloud, developers can enhance their applications with reliable and scalable storage solutions, enabling them to focus on building innovative and data-driven experiences.

### Create Amazon S3 API

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

-   Create in Resources

Sign in to your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

![external_resource](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/external_resource.png)

Select **`Amazon S3`** from the API list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready Amazon S3 will display as shown.

-   Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder on the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`Amazon S3`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to Amazon S3 API.

### Create Actions

We have created an Amazon S3 resource, we can add the action by selecting Amazon S3 from the action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

![amazon_resource_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/assemble/amazon_resource_list.jpg)

Now we have added the Amazon server as an action to our building page.
