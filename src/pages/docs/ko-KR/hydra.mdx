## <h2 hidden>What is Hydra?</h2>

Hydra is a powerful integration within the ILLA Cloud platform that seamlessly connects and consolidates various data sources and applications. Acting as a central hub, Hydra enables efficient data flow and communication between different systems, allowing for real-time data synchronization, automated workflows, and streamlined processes. With its robust capabilities, Hydra empowers businesses to optimize their operations, enhance collaboration, and make data-driven decisions with ease, all within the integrated ecosystem of ILLA Cloud.

### Create Hydra

There are two ways to create a resource in ILLA after signing into your account.

-   Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

![external_resource]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/external_resource.png)

Select **`Hydra`** from the database list.

![action_list]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready Hydra will display as shown.

-   Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`Hydra`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to Hydra database.
