## <Heading hidden>Radio button</Heading>

A radio button is select input component that allows users to select one option from a group of pre-defined options. It appears as a rounded square button, which can be selected or deselected by users. When a radio button is selected, all other radio buttons in the same group are automatically deselected, ensuring that only one option can be selected at a time. Radio buttons are commonly used in forms, questionnaires, and surveys to help users make a single choice from a list of options.

### Properties

#### Manual options

Add new options or delete options manually and configure the options one by one. The properties of options are as follows: 

| Properties | Description                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Label      | The text displayed for the option            |
| Value      | The value associated with the option         |
| Disabled   | Whether the option is disabled for selection |

#### Mapped options

You can also add options from a data source by mapping the label and value properties to the corresponding data fields. You can get options dynamically from the database in this way. At the end of this article, we will demonstrate how to use it through an example.

| Properties  | Description                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data source | Set the data source of options                                   |
| Label       | Use {{item}} to set the label of options                         |
| Value       | Use {{item}} to set the value of options                         |
| Disabled    | Use {{item}} to set whether the option is disabled for selection |

#### Other properties

| Properties              | Description                                                                                                                                                  |

### Method

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following three methods:

#### setValue

To set the selected option, for example, {{”value1”}}

| Properties | Description                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Value      | A string of selected option value.  |

#### clearValue

To clear the selected options

#### validate

To verify that the input information is legal

#### clearValidate

To clear the validation message

### Event handler

We support listening to the `onChange` event of the radio button component. 

When the selected option changes, it can trigger a specified action. This means that when a user selects a different option from a group of radio buttons, a particular action can be taken based on the selected option. For example, in a web form, selecting a different option can trigger the display of different form fields or the submission of the form to a different destination. In this way, the option selected by the user can affect the behavior of the software or web application they are using. The ability to trigger specified actions based on user input is an important aspect of interactive software design and can improve the usability and functionality of the software.

### Data

The component has some commonly used data, which can be called via {{componentName.propertyName}} in the app.

| Property name | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| value         | a string of value of the selected option  |

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to use the mapped mode to dynamically obtain options. 

#### Step 1 Add an action

We have created a table named `selection`, including 5 columns: `options_en`, `options_jp`, `options_zh`, `options_kr`, `value`. We stored the option values in `value` and stored options label in different languages in other columns. 

Create an actions to list all data in `selection` named `postgresql1`

```jsx
select * from selection
```

#### Step 2 Configure the component

1.  Set the Data sources to `{{postgresql1.data}}` 
2.  Configure the label to change the label based on the language. 

    1.  Use {{ item.columnName }} to set the column. 
    2.  Use {{ currentUserInfo.language }} to set the language users use in ILLA.

    ```jsx
    {{currentUserInfo.language=='ja-JP' ? item.options_jp 
    : currentUserInfo.language == 'ko-KR' ? item.options_kr 
    : currentUserInfo.language == 'zh-CN' ? item.options_zh 
    : item.options_en }}
    ```
