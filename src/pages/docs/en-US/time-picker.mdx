## <h2 hidden>What is Time Picker?</h2>

Time picker component is a UI component that allows users to select a specific time from a 24-hour interface, typically used in forms or data entry interfaces where the user needs to specify a specific time.

When a Time picker component is added to canvas, it displays a 24-hour interface that shows hours, minutes, and seconds. The user can adjust the time by moving the mouse cursor or using the up and down arrows.

### Properties

Time picker's available properties. JavaScript may be written to read or alter information about components.

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Default value | The initial value of the component. You can dynamically change the initial value by typing JavaScript in {{}}. |
| Format | A valid date format string. See dayJS. |
| Placeholder | The value will be shown when the input field is empty. |
| Step size | the step size in unit of minutes |
| Label | The name of the field displayed to the user |
| Caption | A caption used to describe the field in detail |
| Hidden label | Set whether to display the label |
| Position | Set the position of the label relative to the component |
| Alignment | Set the alignment (align to left or right) of the label |
| Width | When the label is on the left side of the component, set the width ratio of the label. |
| Event Handler | Trigger queries, control components, or call other APIs in response to component events. |
| Disabled | Control the status of whether the component is disabled. The component cannot be modified or focused when it is disabled. |
| Read Only | Control the status of whether the component is read-only. A read-only component can be selected and focused but cannot be modified. |

| Tooltip | User can enter component tooltip here. The tooltip will be shown when it is focused. Markdown format is supported. |
| Required field | Valid only when the switch is on. |
| Custom rule | Create your validation logic here. The rules should be made in JavaScript and covered by {{}}. |
| Hide validation message | You can hide the error message by switching the hidden status when the input value is incorrect. You can dynamically change the hidden status by JavaScript. |
| Form Data Key | Specify a key of a wrapping form component when constructing the data attribute. |
| Hidden | Dynamically control whether the component is hidden. You can change the hidden status through dynamical boolean value. |
| Theme Color | Allows users to specify the button's background color and opacity |

### Methods

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following four methods:

- **setValue**

To set the input time value, for example, {{"value1"}}

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Value | Input value |
- **clearValue**

To clear the value of the selected component 

- **validate**

To verify that the input information is legal

- **clearValidate**

### Event handler

| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to time picker and set to current time with a button. 

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in REST API called **`promoteCodes`,** including 6 columns:  **`code`**,  **`id`**, **`createdAt`**, **`expiredAt`**, **`startedAt`, `updatedAt`**. We will use the updatedAt time for sample use. 

Then we can create a new action for REST API from the action list, listing all data in promoteCodes and named restapi1. 

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add a **`time picker`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas. For default value of the time component, we set it up as the last update time of first promote code from the rest api data.

```sql
{{restapi1.data.promoteCodes[0].updatedAt}}
```

We also labeled the button as "Now" as shown below

#### Step 3 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the date in **`time picker`** component to current date and time.

1. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, select the **`time picker`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
2. Choose the **`setValue`** action and set the value as  `{{currentUserInfo.updatedAt}}`

#### Step 4 Test

Now that when you click the "Now" button, the time should change to current time. As for here, we have 20:03:05 but it may be different when you are testing it.
