## <h2 hidden>What is Date?</h2>

The Date component is a component that allows users to select a date from a calendar interface. The Date component is typically used in forms or data entry interfaces where the user needs to select a specific date.

When a Date component is added to the canvas, it displays a calendar interface by default. The user can navigate through the calendar by clicking on the previous or next arrows to move to a different month, or by clicking on a specific date to select it. The selected date will be displayed in the input field.

## ****Properties****

Date's available properties. JavaScript may be written to read or alter information about components.

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Default value | The initial value of the component. You can dynamically change the initial value by typing JavaScript in {{}}. |
| Format | A valid date format string. See dayJS. |
| Placeholder | The value will be shown when the input field is empty. |
| Max date | set the maximum date that a user can select from the calendar interface. |
| Min date | specify the earliest date that a user can select from the calendar interface. |

| Event Handler | Trigger queries, control components, or call other APIs in response to component events. |
| Disabled | Control the status of whether the component is disabled. The component cannot be modified or focused when it is disabled. |
| Read Only | Control the status of whether the component is read-only. A read-only component can be selected and focused but cannot be modified. |

To set the input date value, for example, {{'value1'}}

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Value | Input value |

## Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to date and set to current date with a button. 

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in REST API called **`promoteCodes`,** including 6 columns:  **`code`**,  **`id`**, **`createdAt`**, **`expiredAt`**, **`startedAt`, `updatedAt`**. We will use the updatedAt time for sample use. 

Then we can create a new action for REST API from the action list, listing all data in promoteCodes and named restapi1. 

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add a **`date`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas. For default value of the date component, we set it up as the last update time of first promote code from the rest api data.

```sql
{{restapi1.data.promoteCodes[0].updatedAt}}
```

We also labeled the button as "Today" as shown below

#### Step 3 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the date in **`date`** component to today's date.

1. In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, select the **`date`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
2. Choose the **`setValue`** action and set the value as  `{{currentUserInfo.updatedAt}}`

#### Step 4 Test

Now that when you click the "today" button, the time should change to today's date. As for here, we have 2023-5-6 but it may be different when you are testing it.
