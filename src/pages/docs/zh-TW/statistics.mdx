## <h2 hidden>What is Statistics?</h2>

The Statistics component in ILLA Cloud is a powerful tool for displaying and analyzing numerical data. It provides a visually appealing and customizable way to showcase key metrics and statistics.

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

-   **setPrimaryValue**

To set the primary value, for example, {{"value1"}}

| Properties    | Description         |
| ------------- | ------------------- |
| Primary Value | Input primary value |

-   **resetPrimaryValue**

To reset the value to the default value of the selected component. If the default value is not specified, clear value.

Example: {{statistics1.secondaryValue}}

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to statistics with a button.

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in Amazon S3. One of the documents is called

'1.txt' with the decimal '1.1111' as its data. This is the value we want to show in number input.

![s3data]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/s3data.jpg)

Then we can create a new action for Amazon S3 from the action list, listing all the data in the bucket and named s31.

Select `Read an object` for `**Action Type**`. Put `1.txt` for `**Object Key`.\*\*

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

![stat_data]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/stat_data.jpg)

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add a **`statistics`** component and a **`button`** component to the canvas.

We set the default primary value of statistics to 0 and labeled the button as "Set value" as shown below

![stat_layout]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/stat_layout.jpg)

#### Step 3 Configure the component

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to set the value in **`statistics`** component to the data of the document we read from s31 api.

1.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`statistics`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
2.  Choose the **`setValue`** action and set the value as `{{s31.data}}`

![stat_button_config]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/official-site/components/stat_config.jpg)

#### Step 4 Test

Now that when you click the "Set value" button, the value should change to 1.1111.
