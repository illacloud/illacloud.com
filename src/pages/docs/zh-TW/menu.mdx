## <h2 hidden>What is Menu?</h2>

Menu component is a user interface element that provides a navigational structure for accessing different features, options, or sections within the ILLA Cloud application. It typically consists of a list of menu items or links that users can interact with to navigate through various pages or perform specific actions.

### Use case

We will demonstrate how to make a form with name and age as input, as well as bar progress to show the completion progress of the form.

#### Step 1 Set the layout of the pages

Go to the page configuration as the following steps：

![pages]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/pages.png)

You can use the Preset Layouts, or manually add and delete sections to set the layout.

#### Step 2 Add views to a page

**`View path`**: a string spliced after the page URL to access the specified view. After the app is deployed, the complete access address is as follows: https://builder.illacloud.com/{{team_identifier}}/deploy/app/{{app_id}}/{{page_name}}/{{view_path}}

You can also enter the homepage and default view via the following path:

https://builder.illacloud.com/{{team_identifier}}/deploy/app/{{app_id}}

#### Step 3 Connect menu and pages

Add a **`Menu`** component to the top of the page.

Add event handlers to Menu items → set the Action to Set router → select the page and view

For the **`menu`** components, we can configure it to switch between pages and views

1.  Click the **`menu`** component to open its inspect page.
2.  Click an item to open its configuration.
3.  Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
4.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Set Router`** in action, and select the page and the view that you want to route to as the target of the event.

We can do the same for other pages and view you want to route to.

#### Step 4 Test
