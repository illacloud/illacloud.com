## <h2 hidden>What is Timeline?</h2>

A timeline component is a graphical representation of events or data points arranged chronologically along a horizontal or vertical axis. It allows users to visualize and navigate through a series of events or milestones in a linear fashion.

### Properties

Timeline's available properties. JavaScript may be written to read or alter information about components.

| Properties | Description                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Items      | the collection of individual events or data points that are displayed on the timeline |
| Direction  | the orientation or layout of the timeline component (horizontal or vertical)          |
| Pending    | the status of an item in the timeline                                                 |
| Height     | vertical size or height of the timeline component                                     |
| Hidden     | whether the timeline component is visible or hidden                                   |

### Methods

You can use other components to control the component. We support the following two methods:

-   **setValue**

To set the text area input value, for example, {{"value1"}}

| Properties | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Value      | Input value |

-   **clearValue**

To clear the value of the selected component

### Data

The component has some commonly used data, which can be called via **`{{componentName.propertyName}}`** in the app.

| Property name   | Description                                                                                         |

| dynamicHeight   | the ability to adjust the height of the timeline dynamically based on its content or other factors. |
| displayName     | the name of this component (ie timeline1)                                                           |

| pending         | the status of an item in the timeline                                                               |
| resizeDirection | the direction in which the timeline component can be resized by the user                            |

Example: {{timeline1.items}}

### Use case

Next, we will demonstrate how to map the data from the data source to the timeline component.

#### Step 1 Add an action

Let us create a table in Supabase called **`timeline`,** including only 1 columns:  milestones. There are 4 milestones we want to map to the timeline component.

Then we can create a new action for Supabase from the action list and named supabasedb1.

To list all data in milestone, put the code snippet below in the SQL query section.

```sql
select * from timeline;
```

Since the output data is a list of dictionary pair, we want to transform it into an array. In Transformer, enable it and put down the code below.

```jsx
const transformedData = data.map((obj) => Object.values(obj)[0]);
return transformedData;
```

Click **`Save`** and **`Run`** to activate this action.

#### Step 2 Add Components

Next, we can add a **`timeline`** component to the canvas.

In the `**Items**` field in the Inspect page after clicking on the component, put `{{supabasedb1.data}}` to retrieve the data from supabase.

#### Step 3 Test

The final look should be as shown.
