## <h2 hidden>What is Tabs?</h2>

The Tabs component in ILLA Cloud is a versatile feature that allows users to organize and present content in a tabbed layout. It enables the creation of multiple tabs within a single container, allowing users to switch between different sections of content with ease. The Tabs component provides a user-friendly interface for navigating through related information, improving the overall user experience. With customizable styling options and the ability to add various types of content, such as text, images, or embedded components, the Tabs component in ILLA Cloud offers flexibility and enhances the organization and presentation of data.

### Use case

We will demonstrate how to use tabs component combined with a container component to show the three views.

#### Step 1 Add and configure Components

Add a **`container`** component and a **`tabs`** component. In the `inspect` page of the tabs component, turn **`Link to a Container`** on and choose the container you want to link with for `**Container**`.

-   View 1:

This is the home page, thus we place a **`text`** component with "Home" on the upper left corner of the container.

Display a **`text`** component "Hi! Welcome to my personal website" in the middle and a **`button`** component labeled "Learn more about me" under it.

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to go to the next view (view2) if clicked.

1.  Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`container`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`showNextView`** method.

-   View 2:

This is the about page, thus we place a **`text`** component with "About me" on the upper left corner of the container.

Display the "name", "age", and "gender" information with **`text`** components and a profile picture of you or anyone you want to use with the `**image**` component.

Add a **`button`** component labeled "Make friends with me".

For the **`button`** component, we can configure it to go to the next view (view3) if clicked.

1.  Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`container`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`showNextView`** method.

-   View 3

This is the form page, visitor can fill out the form with their information to send a friend request to the owner.

There is a form component in the middle of the container with input components labeled as "Your name", "Your age", and "Gender".

Change the text of the "submit" button in the bottom right corner to "Invite".

![tab_view3](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/tab_view3.jpg)

For the "Invite" **`button`** component, we can configure it to submit the information in the form if clicked.

1.  Click the **`button`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`Control component`** in action, and select the **`form`** component that you want to update as the target of the event.
3.  Choose the **`submit`** method.

For the **`form`** component, we can configure it to show notification if submit.

1.  Click the **`form`** component to open its inspect page. Under **`Event handler`**, click `**+ New**`.
2.  In the Edit event handler, select **`submit`** in Event, select **`Show notification`** in **`action`**, Put "Submit successfully" for Title, "Friend request sent" for Description, and select `Success` for **`Type`**. We want the notification to show for 2s so put `{{2000}}` for the duration.
