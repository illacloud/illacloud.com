## <h2 hidden>What is MongoDB?</h2>

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that is widely used for web applications and other data-driven software. MongoDB is designed to be flexible, scalable, and fast, and is particularly well-suited for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.

In Illa, you can connect to a MongoDB database using the MongoDB Query Resource. This resource allows you to execute MongoDB queries directly from Illa, without having to write any code. You can use the query editor to write queries in MongoDB's native query language, which is based on JavaScript and uses a JSON-like syntax for working with documents.

### Create MongoDB

There are two ways to create a resource in Illa after signing into your Illa account.

-   Create in Resources

Sign into your Illa account, select `**Resources**` on the top of the page, and click `**Create New**` button.

![external_resource](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/external_resource.png)

Select **`MongoDB`** from the database list.

![action_list](https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/action_list.png)

Connect to the database with the required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

After creating a resource, the ready MongoDB will display as shown.

-   Create in Builder

Sign into your Illa account, create a project in Illa Builder in the `**App**` page, and navigate to the **`Action List`** at the bottom of the page. Click `**new**`, then select **`MongoDB`** from the database list. Then, connect to the database with required parameters described in `Connection Settings` below.

Click `**Test Connection**` to see if we can successfully connect to the database. If yes, click **`Save Resources`**, else, double check the hostname, port, username, and password is correct.

### Connection Settings

Here we need to provide information for connecting to MongoDB database.

### Create Actions

We have created a MongoDB resource, we can add the action by selecting MongoDB from action list and choosing the **`Create action`** button.

![mongo_resource_list]\(https://cdn.illacloud.com/official-website/img/docs/mongo_resource_list.png)

Now we have added the MongoDB server as an action to our building page.
